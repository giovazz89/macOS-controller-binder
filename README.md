# Enjoyable: a macOS controller binding tool

Enjoyable is an application for macOS (formerly Mac OS X) which
allows you to use gaming controller/gamepad inputs for sending 
commands as if you were using your mouse or keyboard.

If you have ever played a game which only supports mouse and
keyboard input, but you wanted to use a joystick or gamepad, then
Enjoyable will definitely help you to do that. This effectively
means that even virtual machines, emulators or WINE can benefit from it. 

## Features

Enjoyable currently supports:

 - Mapping gamepad and joystick buttons to keyboard and mouse actions.
 - Fine control over mouse movement and scrolling using analog axis inputs.
 - Automatic and dynamic switching between different input mappings.
 - Downloading and sharing input presets for different applications.
 - Modern OS X features like resume and automatic termination.

Enjoyable is free software written by Joe Wreschnig and is based on
the Enjoy codebase written by [Yifeng Huang](http://nongraphical.com)
and [Sam McCall](http://abstractable.net/enjoy/). Further changes and
improvements made now by [Marcelo Novaes](http://mnovaes.com).

## How to Use

To start, just press a button on your joystick or gamepad, then press
the key you want to map it for. Then press the [▶] button and switch
back to your game. For more details, Enjoyable has a in-application
manual available in Help Viewer via `⌘?`.

## Requirements

- Mac OS X 10.7+.
- One or more HID-compatible (e.g. USB or Bluetooth) input devices.
